# Fix Dependency Conflicts

## The Problem
The old package versions you tried (from 2019-2021) have conflicting dependencies:
- `numpy==1.17.0` conflicts with `tensorflow==1.15.5` (needs numpy<1.19)
- `opencv-python==4.5.5.64` only works with Python 3.7
- `tensorflow==1.15.5` is very old and incompatible with modern Python

## Solutions

### Option 1: Use Fixed Requirements (Recommended)
I've created `requirements.txt` with compatible modern versions:
```bash
# Use the fixed requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Option 2: Use Simple Requirements (No Version Pinning)
```bash
# Use simple requirements without version conflicts
pip install -r requirements-simple.txt
```

### Option 3: Use Build Script
```bash
# Use the build script that installs packages in correct order
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

## For Render Deployment

### Option A: Use Current Configuration
Your current `render.yaml` should work with the fixed `requirements.txt`

### Option B: Use Simple Configuration
```bash
# Switch to simple configuration
mv render.yaml render-complex.yaml
mv render-simple.yaml render.yaml
```

## Local Testing

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set environment variable:**
   ```bash
   export PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION=python
   ```

3. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Why the Old Versions Don't Work

- **Python 3.7 vs 3.12**: Old packages were built for Python 3.7
- **NumPy conflicts**: Different packages need different NumPy versions
- **TensorFlow 1.x vs 2.x**: Completely different APIs
- **Protobuf issues**: Old generated files incompatible with new protobuf

## Recommended Approach

1. Use the fixed `requirements.txt` I created
2. Deploy to Render with current `render.yaml`
3. If issues persist, try `render-simple.yaml`

The fixed versions are:
- Modern and compatible
- Work with Python 3.12
- Have no dependency conflicts
- Include protobuf fix
